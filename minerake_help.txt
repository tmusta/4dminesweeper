 In order to start the game, follow the instructions in the beginning of the program. After the game has been initialized, use the following commands to play it.
 
 [coord]:
                Coordinates in 4DMineRake are given in the form of 1aA, where the number
                represents Y-coordinate, small letter X-coordinate and in 3D and 4D modes 
                capital letter represents the Z-coordinate. The order of symbols doesn't 
                matter. E.g coordinates 1bC becomes (2,1,3), Ac8 = (3,8,1)
          
 step (or s) [coord]:
                Steps on the minefield and opens all the empty patches surrounding it.
                If you open all the patches that aren't mines, you win!
                e.g. step Dc4 or s b2.
                WARNING: Stepping on a mine can be quite unhealthy!
                In 4D, after you have given the command and coordinates, you will have to wait
                through the terasect and press Enter when you want to insert the command.
                HINT: You can also split your 
                
 flag (or f) [coord]:
                Puts up a flag where you think a mine lies. When you have put up as many flags 
                as there are mines, you can check if you win. If you flag a spot that already 
                has a flag, it takes it off. e.g. flag 4e, f 1aA.
                In 4D, the same procedures are taken as in step.
                
 go (or g) [Z-coord]:
                Only in 3D and in 4D. Displays the layer in question e.g go A, g G.
                In 4D you can see all the time levels as in above, until you press Enter.
